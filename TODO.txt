Todo:

1. Fix access and status flag string issues.
1.5 Source Code Dump option using retransform classes to get everything
2. Save runtime settings.
3. Add ability to write class byteocdes to a folder as they are loaded. This would be done in Core - Startup Settings IMPL done
4. Add other decompiler option IMPL
5. Add ability to load jars/classes
5. Implement General Communication channel to allow users to see what is "happening". Function calls and callback waits etc. Just dump System out

Features to impl:

1. Better Class Hooking. Possibly Start process with dll. (Already Implemented on JReverseBridge)
