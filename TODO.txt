Todo:

1. Finish settings impl on core
2. Finish class file editor. Allow modification of classes that have not had bytecodes recorded
3. Add ability to write class byteocdes to a folder as they are loaded. This would be done in Core
4. Add other decompiler option IMPL
5. Fix UI
5. Implement General Communication channel to allow users to see what is "happening". Function calls and callback waits etc.
6. Implement Dynamic Resize of Pipelines or better checks for excessive memory use to avoid dual fatal crashes

Features to impl:

1. Better Class Hooking. Possibly Start process with dll. (Already Implemented on JReverseBridge)
2. Class Editor.
3. Better UI

Notes:

 - Code is messy
 - Make Injectable less Crash Prone
 - Test other applications
